              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>I am a dedicated full stack web developer and out of all the many fields in the IT world, web development is my biggest strength and passion. I am adept both in the front-end and back-end web development. I specialized in JavaScript and PHP as my primary languages. I am also interested in learning about mobile development. I am a fast learner and very eager about learning many things. I am also fond of rock music and play the guitar. Basketball is also one of my hobbies and I am a big fan of the NBA especially the team of Spurs and Lakers. Aside from that, I like comedy series and movies notably 'Silcon Valley', 'Brooklyn Nine Nine', 'The Big Bang Theory' and 'The Hangover' film series.</p>
